# Coding Language - Java
# Program 1 Simple Calculator in Java
This is a basic Java console application that performs arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division)
using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
## Features : 
Accepts two numbers (a and b) as double
Accepts an operation type as a String (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
Handles division by zero with error messaging
Uses a Calculator class to encapsulate operation logic

# Program 2 Odd Number Series Generator in Java
This simple Java console application generates the first a odd numbers, where a is an integer input from the user.
## Features
Accepts an integer input a from the user
Generates the first a odd numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...)
Outputs the numbers in a clean, comma-separated format

# Program 3 Conditional Odd Number Series Generator in Java
This Java console program generates a series of odd numbers based on user input a, with the following rule:
If a is odd, print the first a odd numbers.
If a is even, print the first a - 1 odd numbers.
## Features
Takes a single integer input a
Adjusts the length of the output series based on the parity of a
Prints the odd numbers in a comma-separated list

# Program 4 
This Java console application counts how many numbers from a given list are multiples of each number from 1 to 9.
## Features
Takes a predefined list of integers as input
Counts multiples for each number in the range 1 to 9
Uses a LinkedHashMap to store counts while preserving insertion order
Prints the count of multiples for each divisor as a map output
